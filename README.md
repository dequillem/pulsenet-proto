- **Clean API**: A straightforward interface that minimizes complexity.
- **CMake**: Uses CMake for building and managing dependencies.
- **C++**: Written in modern C++, ensuring efficiency and readability.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with major operating systems.
- **Networking**: Focused on networking capabilities, particularly using UDP.
- **No Exception Handling**: Designed to avoid exceptions for increased reliability.
- **No External Dependency**: Fully self-contained, reducing the overhead of additional libraries.
- **Non-Blocking**: Designed to handle multiple operations simultaneously without waiting.
- **Protocol**: Implements a robust protocol for data transmission.
- **std::expected**: Utilizes `std::expected` for error handling, making it easier to manage outcomes.

## Getting Started

To get started with pulse::net::proto, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++23.
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher).
- Git for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dequillem/pulsenet-proto.git
   cd pulsenet-proto
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run the application:

   After building, you can find the executable in the `build` directory. Run it to see the protocol in action.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can use the provided API to send and receive UDP packets. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```cpp
#include <pulse/net/proto.hpp>

int main() {
    pulse::net::proto::UDPClient client("localhost", 8080);
    client.send("Hello, World!");
    
    std::string response = client.receive();
    std::cout << "Received: " << response << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a UDP client, send a message, and receive a response.
